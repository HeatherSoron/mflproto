            div This Privacy Policy explains how we, MFL Trainer (company registration no. 13388658) of 52 Roslyn Road London N155ET use your personal information which you provide to us.
            div MFL Trainer protects the personal information that you provide to us and is committed to complying with all relevant Data Protection Laws. We are registered with the UK Information Commissioners Office (ICO) as a data processor, for the processing of data on behalf of our customers. We comply with the UK Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA), the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the UK Data Protection Bill.
            br
            div If you have any queries regarding this Privacy Policy, you should contact us at dpo@mfltrainer.com.
            br
            div The ways we gather your personal data are described below. Your data is used in a number of ways by us and we will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
            ul
                li Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you or the school that you attend
                li Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
                li Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
            div Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time.
            div When a school opens an account with us we act as a data processor and process personal information in accordance with the specific instructions of the school. The school will send us a completed school set up form which will contain the names and email addresses of those staff members which the school has nominated to participate in MFL Trainer.
            div Students may access MFL Trainer using a link or code provided by us. The student will be asked to provide personal data such as an email address and form details. We do not email students directly unless this is in response to a specific query/request from a student.
            div We will require schools to provide us with the contact details of the relevant person or people who will be responsible for managing the MFL Trainer account at the school.
            div We treat all personal data concerning children with the utmost protection.
            div The rights set out in this Privacy Policy for data subject apply equally to everyone over the age of 13. Where consent is required from a person who is younger than 13 then it is only valid if given by the parent or guardian of the child.
            div In order to enable teachers and school to evaluate the benefits of MFL Trainer we may provide teachers and schools with a list of those students from the school who are using the service.
            div We will only share your information with third parties where this is necessary for the purposes we have described above. In order to provide our services and to operate our website we use various third parties which are carefully selected by us. All of these third parties have in place policies and procedures to ensure adherence to Data Protections Laws. 
            div There are however certain scenarios where we may have to share your data with other parties where this is required to comply with applicable laws and government or regulatory bodies' lawful requests for information. Examples of these scenarios are:
            ul 
                li For legal reasons, we may be required to share your data with law enforcement agencies, governments, etc. This may be as part of an investigation, or it may be as part of service such as fraud prevention.
                li Where your data may be required to prevent or protect serious physical harm to an individual.
                li If MFL Trainer is involved in an acquisition, a merger, sale of assets, or liquidation. In these circumstances appropriate undertakings would be obtained from the third party.
            div We work hard to ensure the protection of your information against unauthorised access, alteration, destruction, disclosure or use. In order to ensure the level of security your information deserves, we will ensure that any data that moves across an untrusted network (such as the Internet), will be encrypted using strong methods. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet cannot be guaranteed due to the scale and nature of it. We will do our best to protect your personal data, but cannot guarantee the security of your data whilst in transit to our site(s). Any transmission to us is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we use strict procedures and security features to protect it against unauthorised access as reasonably as we can.
            div You have the right to ask us for a copy of the personal information we hold on you, a “subject access request”. You have the right to have any inaccuracies corrected or removed, or to instruct us to cease processing of your data if no longer relevant, or if there are no other legal or contractual obligations for us to do so. There is no fee for this.
            div Subject access requests received from children who are less than 13 years old will be referred back to the parent or guardian of the child for approval.
            div To request a copy of the personal data that we hold on you please send your request in writing to: dpo@mfltrainer.com or by post to The Data Protection Officer, 52 Roslyn Road, London, N155ET.
            div You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.
            div You can review your account information by logging in and going to your settings page. Once logged in you can review and amend your details at any time.
            div If you would like us to erase all of the personal data that we hold on you then you can do so by contacting our Data Protection Officer: dpo@mfltrainer.com or by post to The Data Protection Officer, 52 Roslyn Road, London, N155ET.
            div Please note that if you ask us to delete your personal information then you will not be able to access MFL Trainer.
            div We hold your data only for as long as is necessary for the specified purpose.
            div MFL Trainer offers a personalised service, and in order to be able to offer this same service to users who have taken a break and wish to re-subscribe, we store users' data for a limited time after their course subscription has expired:
            ul
                li Students: - information obtained from students is stored for two years after either (i) the subscription ends or (ii) the account is closed or cancelled.
                li Teachers: - information is held for a period of two years after the account is closed. This is in order to deal with any follow-up queries or to enable an account renewal or re-subscription.
            div You can review your account information by logging in and going to your settings page. Once logged in you can review and amend your details at any time.
            div Like many businesses we may use a third party located outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to help us provide our services. The data that we collect from you may in some cases be transferred to, or stored at, a destination outside the EEA. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers.
            div We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and Data Protection Laws. Where it is necessary to process data outside the EEA we ensure that the relevant third party processing the data has either provided the required contractual undertakings as specified by the EU or is a signatory to the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework.
            div We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type using cookies. This information is used for system administration and/or dynamic adjustments of page layouts to improve your experience on our site.
            div A “cookie” is a small piece of text that is sent by a site you visit and stored in your web browser. Cookies may enable the service or third party to recognise you and make your next visit easier, and the service more useful to you by giving you tailored options based on the information it has stored about your last visit, or it can be used to save display preferences between visits.
